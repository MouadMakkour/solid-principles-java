"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.)
should be open for extension but closed for modification."

- Open for Extension: You should be able to extend the behavior of a class
(usually through inheritance or composition).

- Closed for Modification: The existing code should not be changed when new behavior is added.

Scenario:

You are developing an e-commerce application that handles payments.
Initially, the application supports credit card payments.
Later, the business expands, and you need to add support for PayPal,
Google Pay, and Apple Pay. Instead of modifying the existing payment
handling code each time a new payment method is added,
you want to follow OCP so that the system is open for extension but closed for modification.
