"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
 Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes)."

 In simpler terms, the Dependency Inversion Principle
 suggests that classes should rely on abstractions rather than on concrete implementations.
 This makes the system more flexible and easier to maintain because
 changing the implementation wonâ€™t affect the higher-level components.
