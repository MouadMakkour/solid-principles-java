"A class should have only one reason to change."

This means that a class should have only one job or responsibility.
When a class has more than one responsibility,
changes to one part of the class can affect other parts,
leading to fragile code and making it harder to maintain and extend.

Scenario:

Let's say we are building a Book Management System,
and we have a class that manages both book-related data and handles file export functionality.
This violates SRP because the class is doing two thingsâ€”book management and exporting to a file.
